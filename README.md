# Predict Student Dropout – Classification Model
The Predict Student Dropout project is a machine learning classification model designed to identify students at risk of dropping out based on various academic, demographic, and behavioral factors. By applying supervised learning techniques, the project provides insights that can help institutions take preventive measures to improve student retention. This project demonstrates skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaning and preparing student datasets for modeling  
- **Feature Selection** – Identifying key predictors of student dropout  
- **Classification Models** – Training algorithms to classify at-risk students  
- **Evaluation Metrics** – Measuring performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- **Insights for Intervention** – Supporting data-driven decisions to improve retention strategies  

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  

## Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Predict_Student_DropOut_Classification_Model.git
   cd predict-student-dropout-classification

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

3. **Install dependencies**
